# github.com/chrisdalke/go-serial

A cross-platform serial port library for Go.

## Documentation and examples

See the package documentation here: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/chrisdalke/go-serial

## go.mod transition

This library supports `go.mod` with the import `github.com/chrisdalke/go-serial`.

If you came from the pre-`go.mod` era please update your import paths from `github.com/chrisdalke/go-serial.v1` to `github.com/chrisdalke/go-serial` to receive updates. The latest `v1` release is still available using the old import path.
